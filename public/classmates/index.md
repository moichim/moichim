In cooperation with Martina Horáková, we designed a history book.

In the research project, we found "jewish" students who attended our grammar school before the WWII. Some of them were Jews, others were labelled as such by the racial Norimberg Laws.

The publication brings memories of people who knew those "Jews" before they were expelled from the school and deported. It also includes archive materials and broader historical context. 

The book was designed as a textbook about the Holocaust for grammar schools. It serves as such until today, being issued 3 times in Czech and 2 times in English.

This research was later followed by another project [Room 127](/pokoj-127).
